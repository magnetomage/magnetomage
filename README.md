# Welcome, I'm Magnus ðŸŽ®

I dabble in game development. I work primarily with Godot and Unreal, with a focus on flexible reusable compontents.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently developing an exploration-based puzzle platformer game in Godot 4.2.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning the Godot engine with a focus on data driven design.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about game development, C#, and level design.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I can write in 20 computer languages but I speak just one

  I never use Github repos
